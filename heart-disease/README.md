## 🫀 Project Description

Statistical analysis of patient data from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to investigate factors associated with heart disease. This project is part of my Codecademy portfolio, developed during my Data Scientist: Machine Learning career path, with additional methods self-studied outside of the course.

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used is Codecademy's "Heart Disease" dataset, adapted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of a single CSV file: `heart_disease.csv`.

## 🧾 Data Description

The dataset has been pre-cleaned by Codecademy for analysis and includes the following variables:

| Variable     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `age`        | Age in years |
| `sex`        | Sex assigned at birth (`male` or `female`) |
| `trestbps`   | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| `chol`       | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| `cp`         | Chest pain type (`typical angina`, `atypical angina`, `non-anginal pain`, `asymptomatic`) |
| `exang`      | Exercise-induced angina (`1` = yes, `0` = no) |
| `fbs`        | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (`1` = yes, `0` = no) |
| `thalach`    | Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise |
| `heart_disease` | Presence of heart disease (`presence` or `absence`) |

## ✏️ Key Findings

* Age and maximum heart rate (thalach) differed significantly between heart disease and non-disease groups (T-tests).
* Chest pain type (cp) showed a strong association with heart disease (Chi-Square test).
* A suspected link between asymptomatic cases and lower thalach was not statistically significant (ANOVA).
