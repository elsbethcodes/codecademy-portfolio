## 🏔️ Data Source
The Codecademy "Biodiversity in National Parks" dataset is derived from the National Parks Service and consists of two CSV files: "species_info.csv" and "observations.csv". I have worked on this dataset as a portfolio project to showcase my data science learnings on Codecademy's Data Scientist: Machine Learning career path.
