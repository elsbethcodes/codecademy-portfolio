## 🦅 Project Description

Data analysis of species recorded across four U.S. national parks, exploring biodiversity, conservation status, and observation trends. Developed as part of Codecademy’s Data Scientist: Machine Learning career path to apply data wrangling, aggregation, and visualisation techniques.

## 🏔️ Data Source

The dataset comes from Codecademy’s "Biodiversity in National Parks" project and is based on data from the U.S. National Parks Service. It includes two CSV files:

* `species_info.csv` – species names, categories, and conservation status
* `observations.csv` – species sightings by park

Original source: U.S. National Park Service – [https://www.nps.gov/](https://www.nps.gov/)
